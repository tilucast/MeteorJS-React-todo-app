# Meteor Todo App

This is a todo-app built with MeteorJS.
Check the official tutorial for more in-depth explanation of the concepts: https://react-tutorial.meteor.com/simple-todos/


I'm using Meteor with typescript: `meteor create --typescript new-typescript-app`,
also, i'm using Material UI: https://material-ui.com/getting-started/installation/
for its components.

# Issues

One thing that i'd like to mention, types for Meteor and Mongo seems kinda weird, couldn't find any resources online about some issues i had while coding, you will see them once you download the code and try it for yourself.

The official tutorial has some errors. Some packages they used to make testing doesn't really exists anymore i guess, couldn't find anything about that either.
And some logic errors are present as well.

That being said, the documentation seems well organized and structured. Give it a try.
